## üìä Dataset

- **Columns:**
  - `ds` ‚Äì Date (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - `y` ‚Äì Bandwidth usage (in Mbps)
- **Timeframe:** Daily records over a defined period.
- **Source:** Synthetic data for internal forecasting demonstration.

---

##  Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for nulls and ensured proper datetime formatting.
2. **Model Training with Prophet**  
   - Fitted Prophet model to historical bandwidth usage.
3. **Forecast Generation**  
   - Predicted next 100 days of bandwidth demand.
4. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted forecast with confidence intervals and trend components.

---

## Forecast Result

- The model predicts an overall trend in bandwidth usage.
- Weekly seasonality shows regular usage patterns (e.g., higher weekday traffic).
- Forecast includes 95% confidence intervals (`yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`).

## ‚úÖ Key Insights

- **Trend:** Bandwidth usage shows a (rising/stable/declining) trend.
- **Seasonality:** Peak usage occurs regularly during (specify days if known).
- **Planning:** Forecasting helps in identifying high-load periods for better resource allocation.
